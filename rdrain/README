The RyzCom Drain service is the heart of everything. It receives a
stream of data from each client and stores this on file.

A client is defined as a user (not mashine) and one file for each
client is stored.

Server is a simple console application with a log-in procedure.

The log-in consists of answering which user is connecting and the
version number of the client software (i.e. the rdrain).
