The RyzCom Drain service is the heart of everything. It receives a
stream of data from each client and stores this on file.

A client is defined as a user (not machine) and one file for each
client is stored.

Server is a simple console application with a log-in procedure.

The log-in consists of answering which user is connecting and the
version number of the client software (i.e. the rdrain).


To build this project:
======================

* From clean check out

aclocal
autoheader
automake --add-missing
autoconf
./configure
make
make install


Important note:
===============

If you build from Kdevelop you might get an error saying install.sh is missing.
In that case, open a terminal and cd to the build directory and invoke:

automake --add-missing


To run the server:
==================

rsink [data_directory]

Note that the argument is mandatory. It points out where the logfiles for all users are to be stored and is
needed when the service is started from xinet superserver.


Service from superserver (xinet):
================================
You need to be root to do the following.

Create a file in /etc/xinet.d called rsink and copy&paste the following in it:

# description: An xinetd internal service which echo's characters back to
# clients.
service rdrain
{
        port            = 13999
        disable         = no
#       type            = INTERNAL
#       id              = echo-stream
        socket_type     = stream
#       protocol        = tcp
        user            = ryzcom
        wait            = no
        server          = /usr/local/bin/rdrain
        server_args     = /home/ryzcom/usersdata
}


Edit the file /etc/services and add the line:

rdrain          13999/tcp       nobody

If you dont have a user called ryzcom allready, create one:

adduser ryzcom


Restart your xinet:

/etc/init.d/xinetd restart
