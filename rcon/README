The RyzCom Control service is a server-side application that provides a
front-end of commands to a remote network user. A typical user would be
a guild leader wishing to coordinate his guild based on the groups stats 
and whereabouts, or an advanced player wishing to track his own progress.

All commands are simple scripts following a certain set of rules and one
theoretically let users have an account and telnet in. However, having 
hundreds of users being able to access a server is a security issue.

This module does the same thing, except that only programs in a particular
subdirectory are possible to run and the log-in procedure is simpler.

One could also acheave the same thing by creating a shell gaul, and let
a normal command shell do the job.

To build this project:
======================

* From clean check out

aclocal
autoheader
automake --add-missing
autoconf
./configure
make
make install


Important note:
===============

If you build from Kdevelop you might get an error saying install.sh is missing.
In that case, open a terminal and cd to the build directory and invoke:

automake --add-missing


To run the server:
==================

rcon [data_directory] [<bin_directory>]

Note that the first argument is mandatory. It points out where the logfiles 
for all users are to be stored and is needed when the service is started from 
xinet superserver. 

The second argument is optional. If omitted the program will assume the path to
be: ./bin


Service from superserver (xinet):
================================
You need to be root to do the following.

Create a file in /etc/xinet.d called rcon and copy&paste the following in it:

# description: An xinetd internal service which echo's characters back to
# clients.
service rcon
{
        port            = 13998
        disable         = no
#       type            = INTERNAL
#       id              = echo-stream
        socket_type     = stream
#       protocol        = tcp
        user            = ryzcom
        wait            = no
        server          = /usr/local/bin/rcon
        server_args     = /home/ryzcom/etc /home/ryzcom/usersdata /home/ryzcom/bin_rcon
}


Edit the file /etc/services and add the line:

rcon          13998/tcp       nobody

If you dont have a user called ryzcom allready, create one:

adduser ryzcom


Restart your xinet:

/etc/init.d/xinetd restart


Alternative via TCP servlet
===========================
Run the script rcon_start.sh to invoke a server via the tcpservlet wrapper

Note that in this case only one user at a time can be served.
